nodetest3
---------

Simple node.js app originally copied from Christopher Buecheler's <a href="https://github.com/cwbuecheler/node-tutorial-2-restful-app">node-tutorial-2-restful-app</a>.

It then customizes the tutorial code by adding a call to an external REST API at Riot Games, to fetch League of Legends players by their summoner name(s).

This app demonstrates the MEN stack, as opposed to the MEAN stack, since we are using Mongo, Express, and Node but not Angular. (yet)
